\title{Identify the Knee and Max ECDF Differences for Each Transcript}
\usage{
kneeid(transdflist, expdf, nbcputrans, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{transdflist}{A list of data frames where each data frame contains
transcript data with ECDF values for each condition.}

\item{expdf}{A data frame containing experimental information including a
\code{condition} column.}

\item{nbcputrans}{An integer specifying the number of CPU cores to use for
parallel computation. The parallelization is performed on the elements of
transdflist.}

\item{verbose}{A logical flag indicating whether to print progress messages.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to a transcript and contains
 the coordinates of the knee point and the maximum ECDF difference for each
 condition.
}
\description{
This function identifies the knee point (i.e., point of maximum change) and
the maximum difference in the empirical cumulative distribution function
(ECDF) for each transcript, across different experimental conditions.
}
\examples{
# Assuming transdflist is a list of transcript data frames and expdf contains
# conditions for each experiment:
# result <- kneeid(transdflist, expdf, nbcputrans = 4, verbose = TRUE)
