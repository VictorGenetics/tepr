v1.1.2:
- Modifications and corrections to pass R CMD check.
- Creation of .returnexpcolnames in utils.R.
- Simplification of averageandfilterexprs and create subfunction .expressedtrans.
- In .computeecdf, under the comment "Shrink the results back to the transtable keeping ecdf columns", change code to remove the 'dot' usage which throws an error by R CMD check.
- In .computeecdf, also change the way column names are modified under the comment "Removing strand from column names" for the same reason.
- In .normalizeandsummarize, replace code for "Selecting coord and mean values" to remove the use of dot.
- Remove manual pdf that is not needed
- Add a .github/workflows that test the package on windows, macos, and ubuntu
- Add a .Rbuildignore to exclude the .github folder during package creation
- With the reduced data of the package, the preprocesssing in the "quick start" section of the vignette now takes 47 seconds instead of 7 minutes.
- Now use two different exptab in the package. One for preprocessing and one for the downstream analysis. The code of quick start is modified accordingly.
- The downstream part is now done on 6 transcripts instead of a 100. This aims at reducing the size of the package.
- Correct bug about direction in loop if dfstrandlist of the function .expressedtrans in averageandfilterexprs.
