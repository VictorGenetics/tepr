# Introduction

TepR (Transcription elongation profile in R) is a package for analyzing data
from nascent RNA sequencing data (TT-seq, mNET-seq, PRO-seq, etc.).
The general principle relies on calculating the cumulative signal of nascent RNA
sequencing over the gene body of any given gene or transcription unit. TePR can
identify transcription attenuation sites by comparing profile to a null model
which assumes uniform read density over the entirety of the transcriptional
unit. It can also identify increased or diminished transcription attenuation by
comparing two conditions. Besides rigorous statistical testing and high
sensitivity, a major feature of TepR is its ability to provide the elongation
pattern of each individual gene, including the position of the main attenuation
point when such a phenomenon occurs.
Using TepR, users can visualize and refine genome-wide aggregated analyses of
elongation patterns to robustly identify effects specific to subsets of genes.
These metrics are suitable for internal comparisons (between genes in each
condition) and for studying elongation of the same gene in different conditions
or comparing it to a perfect theoretical uniform elongation.

# Quick start

The example below shows a complete run of the package using two experiments,
the analysis is limited to 100 transcripts.

```{r quickstart, eval = FALSE}

library(tepr)

## Parameters
exppath <-  system.file("extdata", "exptab.csv", package="tepr")
transpath <- system.file("extdata", "cugusi_100.tsv", package="tepr")
expthres <- 0.1
windsize <- 200

## Read input tables
expdf <- read.csv(exppath)
transdf <- read.delim(transpath, header = FALSE)

## Calculate Average Expression and Filter Transcript Data
resallexprs <- averageandfilterexprs(expdf, transdf, expthres)

resatt <- attenuation(resauc, resknee, rescountna, bytranslistmean, expdf,
    resmeandiff)

## Define Universe and Group of Genes Based on Expression Data
res <- universegroup(resatt)
```

# Data

## Description

For a complete analysis, we will use the data of Cugusi *et al* [REF]. To validate this strategy and explore the relevance of TepR metrics in uncovering gene-specific characteristics of elongation, we re-analyzed previous experiments showing that heat shock (HS) induces attenuation in human cultured cells (REF). We compared TT-seq data from HS-stressed and control MRC5-VA cells. The stressed cells were grown for 2h at 42°C, while control cells were kept at 37°C. Both samples underwent a 15-minute pulse of 4-thiouridine (4sU) labelling of nascent transcripts, followed by purification and sequencing.

The package provides a `joinfiles` function to generate the final table that is used as input below. Running the function from the data folder, the default parameters can be used:

```{r mergefiles, eval = FALSE}
library(tepr)

alltsv <- joinfiles()

## Performing type conversion
idxvec <- c(8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25)
invisible(sapply(idxvec, function(idx) alltsv[, idx] <<- as.numeric(alltsv[, idx])))
```

# Standard workflow

To run the analysis described below, the toy-example provided in the `Quick start` section is used. For the plots, the figures obtained running the functions on the complete annotations are also provided. The complete table can be downloaded at `TO DO`.

## Input files

The first table that you need contains information about each experiment along with scores, for each protein-coding and lncRNA annotations retrieved following the steps described in the `Pre-processing` section. Below is a reduced table limited to 100 transcripts. The column names are defined automatically by the function `averageandfilterexprs` later on. For ease of reading, we define them manually here.

```{r reading-anno-scores}
library(tepr)

transpath <- system.file("extdata", "cugusi_100.tsv", package="tepr")
transdf <- read.delim(transpath, header = FALSE)
colnames(transdf) <- c("biotype", "chr", "coor1", "coor2", "transcript", "gene",
    "strand", "window", "id", "ctrl_rep1.plus", "ctrl_rep1.plus_score",
    "ctrl_rep1.minus", "ctrl_rep1.minus_score", "ctrl_rep2.plus",
    "ctrl_rep2.plus_score", "ctrl_rep2.minus", "ctrl_rep2.minus_score",
    "HS_rep1.plus", "HS_rep1.plus_score", "HS_rep1.minus",
    "HS_rep1.minus_score", "HS_rep2.plus", "HS_rep2.plus_score",
    "HS_rep2.minus", "HS_rep2.minus_score")
print(head(transdf, 3))
```

The second table contains information about each replicate:

```{r reading-exptab}
exppath <- system.file("extdata", "exptab.csv", package="tepr")
expdf <- read.csv(exppath)
head(expdf)
```

You can verify the conformity of the table with the utility function `checkexptab`. Note that this verification step is also performed by `averageandfilterexprs`.

```{r checkexptab}
checkexptab(expdf)
```

## Calculate Average Expression and Filter Transcript Data

In order to study changes in patterns of nascent RNA, the first step is to filter out non-expressed transcripts. The expression value of a gene is defined as the mean score on each strand. Remember that scores were extracted from bedgraphs. A gene is considered as expressed if one of the strand means is above a given expression threshold. The threshold above which a gene is considered as expressed is set to 0.1 by default.

```{r averageandfilterexprs}
## Calculate Average Expression and Filter Transcript Data
expthres <- 0.1
resallexprs <- averageandfilterexprs(expdf, transdf, expthres)
```

`resallexprs` is a list which first element contains `transdf` with added column names. The column names are built from `expdf`. The second element contains a vector of the transcripts considered as expressed. This vector will be used for further downstream analyses.

```{r exprsvec}
## Print the first 10 expressed transcripts
head(resallexprs[[2]])
```


## Count NA values per transcript and condition

During the pre-processing, scores falling in intervals belonging to the black list or to low mappability regions of the genome are replaced by NA. The function `countna` enables to retrieve the number of "missing" scores per transcript. This table can be used for further filtering of the data.

```{r countna}
## Count NA values per transcript and condition
rescountna <- countna(resallexprs, expdf)
head(rescountna)
```

## Compute ECDF for Genes Based on Expression Data

This function calculates the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF)
for expressed genes across transcripts. An ECDF is an estimator of the
Cumulative Distribution Function. The ECDF will enable us to answer the question:
*What is the transcription density of windows located at less than X kb from
the TSS?*. In other words, this statistics enables to identify a specific locus
from where transcription decreases. Indeed, if the cumulative transcription
density stops increasing, it means that the windows after the locus have small
values (see plotecdf for a visual). In the following steps, the ECDF is used to
compute the difference with the cumulative distribution (see `meananddifference`),
which is subsequently used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC, see
`allauc`) and the inflection point or *knee* (see `kneeid`).

```{r ecdf}
## Compute ECDF for Genes Based on Expression Data
resecdflist <- genesECDF(resallexprs, expdf)
```

The genesECDF function returns a list which first element is the main table
with additional ecdf columns denoted with the `Fx` prefix.

```{r resecdf}
resecdf <- resecdflist[[1]]
head(as.data.frame(resecdf))
```

The second element returns the number of windows per transcript that we set to
200.

```{r nbwindows}
nbwindows <- resecdflist[[2]]
print(nbwindows)
```


## Compute Mean and Differences of Scores for Each Condition

The function `meandifference` computes two types of statistics, mean values of
scores and ecdf for each replicate (if provided) and difference of mean ecdf
with the cumulative distribution respectively. The mean values between
replicates implies that one column `mean_value` per condition will be returned.
The score `mean_value` column(s) are necessary to calculate the attenuation
scores later on (see `attenuation`). The ecdf `mean_value` are used to computes
a difference with the cumulative distribution that we call *diff_Fx*. The
*diff_Fx* statistics enables to calculate the area under the curve (AUC, see
`allauc`) and the inflection point or *knee* (see `kneeid`).

The difference is defined as: *diff_Fx = meanECDF - cumvec / nbwindows*

```{r meandifference}
## Compute Mean and Differences of Scores for Each Condition
resmeandiff <- meandifference(resecdf, expdf, nbwindows)
head(resmeandiff)
```

To avoid code duplication in the following steps, we transform the above results
into a list which elements contain a given transcript:

```{r splitmeans}
## Split the results by transcripts
bytranslistmean <- split(resmeandiff, factor(resmeandiff$transcript))
```


## Calculate Area Under Curve (AUC) and Differences of AUC for Transcript Data

For each condition (if more than one), the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of
*diff_Fx* (see previous section) is computed with a trapezoidal approximation
(see pracma::trapz):

*AUC = pracma::trapz(transcoord, diff_Fx)*

with transcoord being the positions along the transcript and *diff_Fx* the
difference with the cumulative distribution.

The AUC values enable the comparison of the nascent-rna signal with a constant 
distribution (no attenuation of signal, x = y), or the difference in signal
distribution between two conditions. The difference of AUC is estimated by a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the adjusted p-value is also provided. Finally,
results are returned by transcript along with a mean value that is called
*MeanValueFull*. 

```{r allauc}
## Calculate Area Under Curve (AUC) and Differences of AUC for Transcript Data
resauc <- allauc(bytranslistmean, expdf, nbwindows)
print(head(resauc))
```

## Identify the Knee and Max ECDF Differences for Each Transcript

To assess attenuation in nascent-rna signal, one must identify a significant
change in the signal distribution. To acheive this, tepr identifies the maximum
*diff_Fx*. In other words, it identifies the maximum variation in the signal
"progression" of the empirical cumulative distribution (see `genesECDF` and
`meandifference`). The maximum change is designed by the term *knee* and is
calculated as: *kee = max(diff_Fx)*.

The function returns the position (*Knee_AUC*) and the value (*diff_Fx*) of the
knee.

```{r knee}
## Identify the Knee and Max ECDF Differences for Each Transcript
resknee <- kneeid(bytranslistmean, expdf)
print(head(resknee))
```

## Calculate Attenuation from AUC and Other Transcript Features

The attenuation is the goal value for which the different statistics were
previously computed. The `attenuation` function calculates the mean value of all
window mean scores before and after the knee location. It then provides an
"attenuation score" with the formula: *att <- 100 - downmean / upmean * 100*.
The three values *att*, *downmean*, and *upmean* are provided by the columns
"UP_mean_", "DOWN_mean_", and "Attenuation_".

```{r attenuation}
## Calculate Attenuation from AUC and Other Transcript Features
resatt <- attenuation(resauc, resknee, rescountna, bytranslistmean, expdf,
    resmeandiff)
print(head(resatt))
```

## Define Universe and Group of Genes Based on Expression Data

Before further downstream analysis, the list of transcript to study must be
defined. tepr selects a transcript if it has:

1) Windows long enough
2) Not too many missing values
3) A mean expression value high enough
4) A significant Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

Analytically it gives:

```{r uniselect, eval = FALSE}
window_size > windsizethreshold &
Count_NA < countnathreshold &
meanctrl > meanctrlthreshold &
meanstress > meanstressthreshold &
pvaladj > pvalthreshold
```

What a satisfying threshold for each criterion is depends on the experiments.
The user can adjust the different threshold along the analysis. A transcript
satisfying the above criterion is defined as belonging to the `Universe` of the
transcripts to analyze (Universe column contains TRUE).

The transcript of the Universe are further divided into `Group`. A transcript
belongs to the "attenuated" group if:

1) It belongs to the Universe
2) The Area Under the Curve is high enough
3) The `-log10` of the adjust p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is above x.

Analytically it gives:

```{r attselect, eval = FALSE}
Universe == TRUE &
aucstress > aucstressthreshold &
-log10(pvalks) > attenuatedpvalksthreshold
```

A transcript is considered as not attenuated ("Outgroup") if:

1) The Kolmogorov-Smirnov adjusted p-value is above a threshold
2) The control AUC is between two user-defined thresholds.

Analytically it gives:

```{r outgroup, eval = FALSE}
pvalks > outgrouppvalksthreshold &
aucctrl > aucctrlthresoldhigher & aucctrl < aucctrlthresholdlower
```

The columns `Universe` and `Group` are computed with:

```{r universegroup}
## Define Universe and Group of Genes Based on Expression Data
res <- universegroup(resatt)
print(head(res, 2))
```

## Plotting

tepr enables the visualization of the cumulative transcription density along a
selected transcription unit (`plotecdf`); the comparison of the AUC between two
conditions (`plotauc`); the average transcription density of a user-selected
collection of transcripts (`plotmetagenes`); and of the histogram of the
distance of the knees to the transcription start sites (TSS).

### ECDF

The visualization of the ecdf distribution for a particular transcript (or gene)
can be obtained with:

```{r plotecdf}
colvec <- c("#90AFBB", "#10AFBB", "#FF9A04", "#FC4E07")
plotecdf(resmeandiff, res, expdf, "EGFR", colvec, plot = TRUE)

### AUC

The AUC values between conditions can be compared either by highlighting the
two conditions on the plot:

```{r plotaucgroups}
plotauc(res, plottype = "groups", plot = TRUE)
```

The plot on the complete dataset gives:

TO DO

It is also possible to compare the AUC by coloring points according to the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test adjusted p-values and to indicate graphically the points
corresponding to a group of genes:

```
genevec <- c("EGFR", "DAP", "FLI1", "MARCHF6", "LINC01619")
plotauc(res, genevec, plot = TRUE)
```

The plot on the complete dataset gives:

TO DO


### Metagenes

The average transcription density along a meta-transcript or a meta-gene can be
visualized with:

```{r metageneplot}
plotmetagenes(unigroupdf, "attenuation", plot = TRUE)
```

The plot on the complete dataset gives:

TO DO

Note that the second parameter tells to plot the distribution for the
transcripts identified as "attenuated" by the function `universegroup`. The
function also enables to select the transcripts categorized as "outgroup",
all the transcripts belonging to the "universe", or all the transcripts of the
initial table ("all").

### Histogram

One can visualize the distance of the knees from the TSS by percentage:

```{r kneepercent}
plothistoknee(res, plot = TRUE)
```

The plot on the complete dataset gives:

TO DO

The distance can also be visualised in kilobases (kb) by changing the *plottype*
parameter:

```{r kneekb}
plothistoknee(res, plottype = "kb", plot = TRUE)
```
