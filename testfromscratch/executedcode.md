The first piece of code was executed from `testfromscratch/` in which the annotation file `gencode.v43.basic.annotation.gtf` was copied. The folder hence contains only one file at this point. Retrieving the code from `BashAndR\pre-study\documentation\TSV_creation_lite_20240617.html`, and replacing `*gtf` by `gencode.v43.basic.annotation.gtf` (otherwise it generates an infinite loop), the first piece of code executed is:

```
#!/usr/bin/sh

grep -w transcript gencode.v43.basic.annotation.gtf | grep -w MANE_Select > MANE_Select.protein_coding.gtf

awk 'OFS="\t" {print $0}' MANE_Select.protein_coding.gtf | tr -d '";' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n  | awk -F \t -v OFS='\t' '{print $0}' | awk -v OFS="\t" '{ print $1,$4,$5,$12,$16,$7}' > MANE_Select.protein_coding.bed
```
