You can find here the input files to run the script1: 
The script is divided into two annotation chunk, one relative to the protein-coding genes, the other to lncRNA gene. This is just because i started to write the code exclusively for protein coding genes, and then expanded it.

blacklist: hg38-blacklist.v2.sorted.chr22.bed
umapk50: k50.umap.hg38.0.8.chr22.bed

For protein_coding chunk:
ANNOTATION:  MANE_Select.protein_coding.chr22.bed
windowS: v43.MANE_protein.window200.chr22.bed

For lncRNA chunk:
ANNOTATION: Ensembl_canonical_TSL123.lncRNA.chr22.bed
windowS: v43.Ensembl_canonical_TSL123.lncRNA.chr22.bed
